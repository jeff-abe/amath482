# A Portfolio of Projects on Computational Methods for Data Analysis
### By. Jeffrey Abraham
This repository contains a collection of projects done for an applied math course titled Computational Methods for Data Analysis.
The 5 Projects were my executions of open ended projects the prompts for which are included in each folder.

## An Overview of the Projects

- Project 1: Applications of FFT to Filtering Noise from Ultrasound Data
  - The purpose of this report is to show the process of developing an algorithm to ﬁlter ultrasound data and ﬁnd the trajectory of an object through multiple snapshots. This is accomplished using Fourier transforms, averaging, and Gaussian ﬁlters.
- Project 2: Time Frequency Analysis Applied to Music 
  - The purpose of this report is to explore the G´abor transform as a method of time frequency analysis with different window functions, and widths. The G´abor method is also used to create a musical score for a short audio recording of a song on multiple instruments.
- Project 3: Principle Component Analysis on Videos of Simple Harmonic Oscillators
- Project 4: Using Linear Discriminant Analysis to Build a Tertiary Classiﬁer for Music
- Project 5: An Introduction to Neural Networks for Classiﬁcation of the Fashion-MNIST Dataset

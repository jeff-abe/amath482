# A Portfolio of Projects on Computational Methods for Data Analysis
### By. Jeffrey Abraham
This repository contains a collection of projects done for an applied math course titled Computational Methods for Data Analysis.
The 5 Projects were my executions of open ended projects the prompts for which are included in each folder.

## An Overview of the Projects

- Project 1: Applications of FFT to Filtering Noise from Ultrasound Data
- Project 2: Time Frequency Analysis Applied to Music 
- Project 3: Principle Component Analysis on Videos of Simple Harmonic Oscillators
- Project 4: Using Linear Discriminant Analysis to Build a Tertiary Classiﬁer for Music
- Project 5: An Introduction to Neural Networks for Classiﬁcation of the Fashion-MNIST Dataset
